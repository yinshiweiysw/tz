# hormuz-strait

Real-time Strait of Hormuz monitoring for energy market and geopolitical risk research via the [Hormuz Strait Monitor](https://hormuzstraitmonitor.com) dashboard API.

## What it does

Fetches the current status of the Strait of Hormuz and presents a risk briefing covering:

- **Strait status** — open, restricted, or closed, with duration and description
- **Ship traffic** — current transits, 24h count, and percent of normal baseline
- **Oil price impact** — Brent crude price with 24h change and trend
- **Stranded vessels** — count by type (tankers, bulk, other) with daily change
- **Insurance risk** — war risk premium level, percentage, and multiplier vs. normal
- **Cargo throughput** — daily DWT vs. average with 7-day trend
- **Diplomatic status** — current situation, parties involved, and headline
- **Global trade impact** — percent of world oil/LNG at risk, daily cost, affected regions, alternative routes, and supply chain disruption
- **Crisis timeline** — chronological events (military, diplomatic, economic)
- **Latest news** — recent articles with sources and links

**This skill is read-only.** No authentication required — uses the public dashboard API.
