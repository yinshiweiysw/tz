# twitter-reader

Read-only Twitter/X skill for financial research using [opencli](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli).

## What it does

Reads Twitter/X for financial research — searching market discussions, reading analyst tweets, tracking sentiment, and monitoring financial news. Capabilities include:

- **Home feed / timeline** — read your feed ("For You" or "Following")
- **Search** — find tweets by keyword with relevance or recency filters
- **Trending** — view trending topics for market themes
- **Bookmarks** — view your saved tweets
- **User profiles** — look up users, their followers, and following
- **Tweet threads & articles** — view specific threads and long-form articles

**This skill is read-only.** It does NOT support posting, liking, retweeting, replying, or any write operations.

## Authentication

No API keys needed — opencli reuses your existing Chrome browser session via the Browser Bridge extension. Just be logged into x.com in Chrome.

## Triggers

- "check my feed", "search Twitter for", "show my bookmarks"
- "what are people saying about AAPL", "market sentiment on Twitter"
- "look up @user", "who follows", "fintwit", "what's trending"
- Any mention of Twitter/X in context of financial news or market research

## Platform

Works on **Claude Code** and other CLI-based agents. Does **not** work on Claude.ai — the sandbox restricts network access and binaries required by opencli.
